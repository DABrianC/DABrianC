- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @DABrianC

**Highlighted projects** <br>
*My Website* <br>
I built my [personal website](https://dabrianc.github.io/website/) using Quarto, and it contains a blog titled [Humans Learning](https://dabrianc.github.io/website/blog.html) that provides examples of R scripts that provides code and examples of how to work with data. 

*30 Day Map Challenge* <br>
A fun mapping challenge that happens every November. Each day is a new map prompt. A prompt may be lines, dots, interactive, polygons, etc. It is a great creative and data visualization challenge. In 2022, I managed to complete 10 days of the challenge. You can view [my 2022 repo](https://github.com/DABrianC/30-day-map-challenge-2022-), and [my 2023 repo](https://github.com/DABrianC/30-day-map-challenge-2023).
