- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @DABrianC
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in data visualization, data analysis, GIS, sports, and travel.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning R and brushing up on my statistics and GIS skills.

**ACLED Data Exploration** <br>
These two links will show you some simple data visualization blog posts that I've done using data from the Armed Conflict Location and Event Data database.

**Animated Data** <br>
I think it's fun to animate data so here are a few examples of my efforts. I first wanted to learn how to make [a bar chart that reorders itself each day](https://github.com/DABrianC/ACLED-Sandbox/blob/main/WestAfricaEventsDaily.gif). Once I did that I wanted to understand how to make [a bar chart] that adds each day cumulatively and also reorders itself. These were both fun to make.
