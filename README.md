- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @DABrianC
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in data visualization, data analysis, GIS, sports, and travel.
- I use Quarto for reports, presentations, dashboards, and blog posts. 
- ðŸŒ± I founded an R users group at my last job

**Highlighted projects**
I built my [personal website](https://dabrianc.github.io/website/) using Quarto, and it contains a blog titled [Humans Learning](https://dabrianc.github.io/website/blog.html) that provides examples of R scripts that provides code and examples of how to work with data. 

**30 Day Map Challenge**
A fun mapping challenge that happens every November. Each day is a new map prompt. A prompt may be lines, dots, interactive, polygons, etc. It is a great creative and data visualization challenge. My 2022 repo is the most that I've done to date. I also managed to do a few days in 2023.
